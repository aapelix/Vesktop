# Vesktop (uncute edition)

### Currently the only way to install this version of Vesktop is to build it from source
### because I'm too lazy to make a proper release. See [building from source](#building-from-source) below

Vesktop is a custom Discord desktop app

**Main features**:
- Vencord preinstalled
- Much more lightweight and faster than the official Discord app
- Linux Screenshare with sound & wayland
- Much better privacy, since Discord has no access to your system

**Not yet supported**:
- Global Keybinds
- see the [Roadmap](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/issues/324)

## Installing

### Building from Source

Packaging will create builds in the dist/ folder

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aapelix/Vesktop
cd Vesktop

# Install Dependencies
pnpm i

# Either run it without packaging
pnpm start

# Or package
pnpm package
# Or only build the pacman target
pnpm package --linux pacman
# Or package to a directory only
pnpm package:dir
```

# Huge thanks to https://github.com/Covkie for making the icons. Hoping I can even use them :skull:
